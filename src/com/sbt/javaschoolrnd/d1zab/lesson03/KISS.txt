Tonight I wanna give it all to you
In the darkness there's so much I wanna do
And tonight
I wanna lay it all at your feet
'Cause girl I was made for you
And girl you were made for me

I was made for loving you baby
You were made for loving me
And I can't get enough of you baby
Can you get enough of me
